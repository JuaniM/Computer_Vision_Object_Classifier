# ObjectClassifier_DataAugmentation_TransferLearning

Here I build a Convolutional Neural Network to solve an object classification problem through Computer Vision. Then I perform a technique called 'Data Augmentation' to increase the size of the training dataset used, and thereby achieve better accuracy. Finally, I apply another tecnique, 'Transfer Learning', to improve my model's training wit the ResNet-50 dataset.
