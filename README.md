<b> An Object Classifier built with a CNN and imporved by both Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning </b>

Here I build a <em> Convolutional Neural Network </em> to solve an object classification problem through Computer Vision. Then I perform a technique called <em> Data Augmentation </em> to increase the size of the training dataset used, and thereby achieve better accuracy. Finally, I apply another tecnique, <em> Transfer Learning </em>, to improve my model's training with the ResNet-50 dataset.

The repository includes all the <em> .ipynb </em> and the <em> .csv </em> used.
